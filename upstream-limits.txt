# This file is used to express limits we want to have on new upstream tarballs.
#
# It's possible to decide to:
#
#  + not have unstable versions (for modules following the x.y.z release
#    scheme, where it's unstable when y is odd)
#    Use the no-odd-unstable instruction for this behavior.
#
#  + not have a version greater or equal than a specified version.
#    Use the "max|x.y" instruction for this behavior.
#
#  + not have specific versions.
#    Use the "skip|x.y;a.b;..." instruction for this behavior
